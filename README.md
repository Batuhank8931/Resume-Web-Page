# Resume-Web-Page
To see my own page please see; https://batuhankarakaya.net/

And open index.html file with cross-platform web server like XAMMP OR WampServer. Otherwise php codes that saves and loads data won't work.

All the data which seen in the web page comes from "maindata.txt" file. If you change the data in "maindata.txt" Web Page will change. 

In this web page only Navbar, sidebar headers and 3 pages are constant. All data is loaded from "maindata.txt".

If you have SQL server you can directly get the data from that server. In order to do that please see the codes inside "source.php".

If you want load the "maindata.txt" data to your SQL server, you can use "datasender.php" in data_sender file.
